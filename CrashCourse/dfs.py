"""
When to use DFS #
Tree #
DFS is essentially pre-order tree traversal.

Traverse and find/create/modify/delete node
Traverse with return value (finding max subtree, detect balanced tree)
Combinatorial problems #
DFS/backtracking and combinatorial problems are a match made in heaven (or silver bullet and werewolf ðŸ˜…). As we will see in the Combinatorial Search module, combinatorial search problems boil down to searching in trees.

How many ways are there to arrange something
Find all possible combinations of â€¦
Find all solutions to a puzzle
Graph #
Trees are special graphs that have no cycle. We can still use DFS in graphs with cycles. We just have to record the nodes we have visited and avoid re-visiting them and going into an infinite loop.

Find a path from point A to B
Find connected components
Detect cycles
