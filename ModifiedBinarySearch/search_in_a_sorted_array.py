"""
TIME COMPLEXITY: There are two parts of the algorithm. In the first part, we keep increasing the bound's size 
exponentially(double it every time) while searching for the proper bounds. Therefore, this step will take O(logN)
assuming that the array will have max N numbers. In the second step, we perform the binary search which will take O(logN),
so the overall time complexity of our algo will be O(logN + logN) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(logN)
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
